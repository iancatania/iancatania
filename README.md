- Hi, I’m Ian Catania.
- I’m interested in cybersecurity and software development, specifically through object-oriented programming. I have the most experience with Java and Python, but I'm always looking to improve my skills in other languages. I'm familiar with SQL databases, specifically through the MYSQL suite and the Django framework for database integration with Python. I have some experience with Wireshark and similar networking tools as well.
- I like to build small applications and games as personal projects in my own time. Right now, I'm teaching myself simple game design in Python to get more experience with long form projects.
- You can reach me at iancatania.cs@gmail.com if you'd like to get in contact!
