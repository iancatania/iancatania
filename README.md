- Hi, I’m Ian Catania.
- I’m interested in software development, specifically through object-oriented programming. I consider myself full-stack, as I have both back and front end experience, and enjoy both. 
- I have the most experience with Java and Python, but I'm always looking to improve my skills in other languages such as C++ and Kotlin. I'm familiar with SQL databases, specifically through the MYSQL suite and SQLite3.
- In frontend development, I am most experienced in the Django web framework with Python, as well as HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 
- Currently I am teaching myself React and Node.js to have a better grasp of full-stack development frameworks. I also would soon like to work with AWS and C# with the .NET framework.
- You can reach me at iancatania.cs@gmail.com if you'd like to get in contact!
